# Nau Frutos do Mar Redesign

[Live Version](https://nau-restaurante.herokuapp.com/)

[Nau Frutos do Mar](http://site.naufrutosdomar.com.br/) is a seafood restaurant with several units all across Brazil. I redesigned their website because they're a locally known, well-established brand whose website isn't fit to the current standards of web design. **This is NOT an official redesign**, it was made for study purposes only, so if you need to contact them, please refer to their [original website](http://site.naufrutosdomar.com.br/). This application was made with [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com.br/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/), [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) and Vanilla JS, with [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) as the task runner.
