# Nau Frutos do Mar Redesign

[Live Version](https://nau-restaurante.herokuapp.com/)

[Nau Frutos do Mar]() is a seafood restaurant with several units all across Brazil. I redesigned their website for study purposes, because they're a locally known, well-established brand whose website isn't fit to the current standards of web design. **This is NOT an official redesign**, it was made for study purposes only, so if you need to contact them, please refer to [their website](). This application was made with [Bootstrap 4](), [SASS]() and [Vanilla JS](), using [Gulp]() as the task runner.
